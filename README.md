A simple project for a live chat using Spring Boot, WebSocket, HTML and JS:

The project makes real-time chat available via WebSocket without authentication using Spring Boot to speed up and simplify the work, finally, I connected a simple front-end interface.
I used this dependencies in Spring Boot: lombok, spring-boot-starter-web and spring-boot-starter-websocket with Eclipse as IDE.

Basically I took three steps: add a WebSocket broker configuration, add a disconnect event listener and add the chat Controller.
